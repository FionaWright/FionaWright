## About Me

Graphics Programmer / Real-Time Rendering Engineer focused on DX12, HLSL and low-level systems  
My skills cover a broad area including assembly, gamedev, maths/stats/physics and data analysis  
I'm comfortable in graphics APIs and GPU debuggers/profilers such as RenderDoc, PIX and NSight Graphics  
Currently a third year computer science student at Trinity College Dublin

## Work Experience
### Qualcomm - Graphics Internship 5/2025-8/2025
Worked on graphics related systems using C++, HLSL and Python  
Gained experience in shader development, validation pipelines, performance profiling, CI/CD, and data analysis  
Returning intern for summer 2026  

### Silvermine Studios - Gamedev Internship 5/2024-6/2024
Developed custom shaders in Unity to establish and refine the visual style of their game Chaos Riders  

## Languages
### Primary
- C++    : My main language for the past few years. I generally stick with C++20  
- HLSL   : I'm very familiar with this shading language and am very comfortable writing all kinds of shaders in it  
- Java   : Main language used in college, I'm comfortable in it
- C#, CMAKE, Python, C
### Secondary
- ARM-CM3/IA-32/RISC-V Assembly : Learned all three in college enough that I can write confidently
